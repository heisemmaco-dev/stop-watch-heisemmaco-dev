## Overview
This is all about my practice with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT together for the third time, i can fell that energy, let go through what i used.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- when the user click on the start button

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

i learned alot from this project, this are the couple things i learnt some syntax i used from my first project i did with javascript
- using array and loop, also looping through an array

```js
// how to use setInterval to run a function

setInterval(callTheFunction, theduration)

// using clearInterval to perfume the stop function

clearInterval(theIntervalId)

```

- using if statement effectively
```js
if (condition) {
  // run this
}
```
- how to use functions effectively
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}

//or

function proudOfThisFunc() {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

- learn how to calculate the second, minute, hours and days

### Continued development

i will like to  continue developing my dom manipulation knowlegde, and how to use arrow function effectively and how to nest my code especially the arrow function, i find it a little bit confusing but i will get to it.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.Google.com) - This helped me for some of the concept i didn't know how to use. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
